2681,[Feature]  Trigger warning Rating,closed,[],2023-06-17T05:28:02Z,CBID2,"## Introducing Myself 
Hi @sindresorhus! I'm CBID2, and I found this project via the Topics Tab on GitHub, so I'm excited to be here! :) 
##  Related Issue

Connects to #732 

## Concern
Adding more non-tech lists is a great idea. However, a possible problem that could occur is a person goes to a list (For context, let's say there's a list of Awesome Animated shows) and ends up finding content that might negatively affect their mental health(e.g., the murder scene in Invincible). 

## Solution
Add GitHub Action that automatically closes a pull request if a contributor does not add a trigger warning in their PR.

2239,Draft process and list placement,closed,[],2022-04-19T00:52:28Z,cnpryer,"Hi! Love this. A couple questions:

1. Is there a draft process for baking lists? (Prevent duplicates or redundant effort)
2. For lists that focus on something like a library that spans multiple languages and domains, where would a list like this fit?


### Drafting

>Don't open a Draft / WIP pull request while you work on the guidelines. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it.

The goal is to add an `awesome` list to the `awesome` tree. If you want to centralize the community's effort, wouldn't it help to submit a draft PR here to provide that visibility (almost like self-assign)?

### List placement (category)
I'm baking [awesome-polars](https://github.com/cnpryer/awesome-polars) that is very early stage. Since I have a lot of time to get this all figured out (and do [a couple reviews](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/pull_request_template.md#requirements-for-your-pull-request)), I want to make sure I know where to aim for and how placement works.

If it were solely a Python ecosystem topic awesome-python would probably make sense (correct me if I'm wrong), but it's a Rust library with supported bindings for a couple languages. Visibility within the Python ecosystem is just as important as it is in the Rust ecosystem. Since it's a DataFrame library it could also be considered part of several domains/non-language categories.

Any advice here would be appreciated! üòÑ ",https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/2239

In order to have it listed here, I had to put a lot more work into it. It turns out that those guidelines are so that the list renders appropriately on project-awesome.org, where you strip out links, such as to our community Slack channel, provide no link back to the original list and display advertisements. The fatal blow is that because you have higher page rank, you prevent the original lists from ranking well in Google, having your own website show up instead. This is a very predatory practice, and it's being done fully intentionally and with the full knowledge of @sindresorhus, who has employed this strategy intentionally.

- When I'm looking at a list, eg https://awesomelists.top/#repos/onurakpolat/awesome-bigdata

- I want a URL with anchor `data-ingestion` to be in the address bar
- So I can share that with a co-worker directly, eg https://awesomelists.top/#repos/onurakpolat/awesome-bigdata--data-ingestion

Notes:
- Inspect of the links on top shows there is something like that in the HTML eg
```
<a class=""cate-anchor"" data-anchor=""#data-ingestion"">Data Ingestion</a>

- Such anchors exist on github and are usable, eg https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-bigdata/blob/master/#data-ingestion

  - Go to https://awesomelists.top/#repos/onurakpolat/awesome-bigdata

- A URL with two hashes `https://awesomelists.top/#repos/onurakpolat/awesome-bigdata#data-ingestion` is not valid, and if I use this, your site gets confused

1920,Creating a GitHub Action that tweets new Awesome Entries,closed,[],2020-12-13T10:33:21Z,Ly0n,"Hey Awesome people,

Problem:
I love awesome lists but they do have one essential problem. It is very hard to follow new projects on awesome lists.
It would be nice to create a newsfeed for readers to stay informed about new entries. 

Solution.
We created a simple GitHub Action that creates tweets based on the commit messages. Contributors can define there own custom tweet message by defining the Pull Request title in a corresponding way. 

The script checks if the last commit message on the main branch contains `https` and creates a tweet based on the corresponding line.
https://github.com/protontypes/awesome-twitter-action

1. Add the Github Action Script to .github/workflows/tweet.yml
2. Create a Twitter Developer Account.
3. Add the Login data to your project secrets.
4. Activate your Github Actions by pressing the Activate GitHub Action for this Projects button on the Action Tab of your project.
5. Create a Commit Message with an URL. Since the title of a pull request is included in the commit message, contributors can create user-specific Twitter messages.

It would be nice to get your feedback. The action is already integrated here: 
https://github.com/protontypes/awesome-robotic-tooling

Do you see any better integration that might be more intuitive and fit better in the Awesome list workflow? At the moment we assume that every commit is always a new project entry. ",https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/1920

First of all, this is great work and it serves a first reference to look for some awesome things, specifically in terms of rapidly growing frontend ecosystem.

However, sometime the project listed here is get archived (by it's owner), what is the guideline in this regards?  
Should the listing have some text or indicator that says it before user go to particular repository and find out that author/maintainers no longer believe in the idea (or just have no time to or have more awesome stuff to work) ?

1598,awesome-oss-sdgs  & CC0 license trick,closed,[],2019-08-04T03:33:30Z,AdrienLemaire,"Hi,

I'm creating a new awesome list for ""Awesome Open Source projects dedicated to tackling global challenges"", and looking at the [Requirements for your Awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/pull_request_template.md#requirements-for-your-awesome-list), it took me a while to figure out the proper way to add the license to the repo.

The trick is in [this comment](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/496#issuecomment-341561904).

After creating a github repo, we can simply go `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/community/license/new?branch=master&template=cc0-1.0`, and it will nicely appear in [the LICENSE page](https://github.com/Fandekasp/awesome-oss-sdgs/blob/master/LICENSE).

Adding this trick to the ""Has an appropriate license"" section of the doc could be useful for future contributors. Also, being more specific about the `please add comment with just the word unicorn` part could avoid some errors. I added the comment [in the git commit](https://github.com/Fandekasp/awesome-oss-sdgs/commit/ffcb7d229c22120172ca27d17c880fa737f6b456), and I doubt you'll notice it when I submit the repo next month.",https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/1598

I have seen that related Unity3D (awesome) repositories already exists on Github. These are some of them:

- https://github.com/RyanNielson/awesome-unity
- https://github.com/insthync/awesome-unity3d
- https://github.com/netpyoung/awesome-unity-free

but most are outdated or aren't as complete as I could expect.

So I've decided to for the first one and add the contents of all of them in one repository called [Awesome Unity](https://github.com/agarcialeon/awesome-unity/). 

It includes a logo as other awesome lists, best clarification of the goals of the repository and to do items that can provide work to visitors.

I have included learning resources and a wiki that I will complete step by step to provide a well defined Unity3D guide to beginners/intermediate/advanced users to quickly improve its work while developing with this game engine.

I'll try to contact with the owners of the rest of the repositories in order to agree in sharing this only repository and improve it as much as possible.

Could be possible to add this repository to the list to get more attention of Unity developers?

Thanks.

Note: Some of the resources are starred repositories that I keep while in search of a good solution for common tasks that I do in Unity. But I expect that users contribute with their own options.

1438,ListList service and Awesome lists,closed,[],2018-10-29T08:16:18Z,aschrijver,"I created this issue separately from [How to grow Awesome?](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/784) as a reaction to @maltsev 's https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/784#issuecomment-432389273 presenting the [ListList](https://listlist.net/) service.

I think @maltsev created a great project here that has potential to grow the reach of Awesome to a broader public than Github users. I [proposed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/784#issuecomment-384223195) having a tool to generate a HTML page of an awesome list, which @sindresorhus found to be overkill (a valid point, I can understand).

The ListList service however, adds an aggregated view to this, plus - importantly - the RSS feed feature, which I think is real added value to Awesome (I am a great proponent of the [decentralized web](https://community.humanetech.com/t/towards-the-vision-of-the-decentralized-web/530), and this fits in).

@maltsev just [PR'ed](https://github.com/engagingspaces/awesome-humane-tech/pull/5) a feed badge to my [awesome-humane-tech](https://github.com/engagingspaces/awesome-humane-tech) list, but before merging I have some things (improvements, discussion points) I'd like to bring up:

- I could not find a repo for the ListList project (maybe it is on Gitlab). For me to add ListList badge, I'd like the project to be open-sourced, just like all other awesome list repo's

- There is no clear license on the ListList page. My list and the top-level one (and most others probably) live in the public domain. I'd like ListList to have a public domain license too.

- The ListList drops the Awesome branding. There is no awesome logo, and the collection is called _""A curated list of spectacular lists""_ .

- With code repositories the number of stars says nothing about the quality of the project. But with awesome lists they do. The stars are a direct reflection how useful/valuable people think the list is. With ListList people don't land on the repo README anymore, and be less inclined to drill-down and give a star. I think ListList should have a starring capability that makes this just as easy again.

- And the last point stems from my [Humane Tech](https://humanetech.com) focus: When subscribing by email, people should know your Privacy Policy. Also there is Google Tag Manager tracker on the page and use of sentry.io. Not having a PP would probably put you in breach of EU GDPR.

Related to #1363 and the goal of maintaining Sindre's sanity üíØ 

Here's my proposed game plan:
- create a linter based off of `awesome-lint` that lints this repo's `readme.md` to verify formatting and extract all the sub-lists
- this linter validates every awesome list linked to via `awesome-lint`
- maintainers will only consider PRs once they pass this CI step

There will be some existing awesome lists that don't pass `awesome-lint`, so we could whitelist these for now and incrementally fix them until the whitelist can be removed.

This would also put more onus on the `awesome-lint` project which appears to have been inactive for some time.

Possible future extensions:
- Include `awesome-lint` in the default `awesome` list template such that it would be enforced via CI for sub-awesome lists going forwards.

In my case I made the parent window sticky in hopping I could use it across many tags. But in my surprise the child window popped up from its parent not showing in my current workspace (tag).

1. Open a window (apps) in a specified tag/workspace  (e.g tag 1)
2. Make that window sticky
3. Move to to other tag/workspace
4. Open child window (pop up windows) from parent apps.

### [The appropriation of GitHub for curation](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-134.pdf)

> GitHub is a widely used online collaborative software development environment. In this paper, we describe curation projects as a new category of GitHub project that collects, evaluates, and preserves resources for software developers.

> We investigate:
> 1. what motivates software developers to curate resources;
> 2. why curation has occurred on GitHub;
> 3. how curated resources are used by software developers; and
> 4. how the GitHub platform could better support these practices.

> We conduct in-depth interviews with 16 software developers, each of whom hosts curation projects on GitHub. Our results suggest that the motivators that inspire software developers to curate resources on GitHub are similar to those that motivate them to participate in the development of open source projects. Convenient tools (e.g., Markdown syntax and Git version control system) and the opportunity to address professional needs of a large number of peers attract developers to engage in curation projects on GitHub. Benefits of curating on GitHub include learning opportunities, support for development work, and professional interaction. However, curation is limited by GitHub‚Äôs document structure, format, and a lack of key features, such as search. In light of this, we propose design possibilities to encourage and improve appropriations of GitHub for curation.

Making a meta list focusing on libraries and containing only awesome lists that curate libraries has following advantages

 - Better overview. ~4 times less lists.
 - Higher quality requirements. Many lists focus is on learning material and neglect the library part. These are not included in the meta list for programming libraries.
 - Improved UI. Since most libraries are hosted on GitHub, a tailored UI can be built, e.g. something like http://devarchy.com/react-components.

The obvious drawback is having two similar meta lists which may lead to confusion.

Beyond that the goal is to increase awareness that awesome lists are a good way to find libraries.
Most programmers I meet don't know about awesome lists so there is likely lot's of potential.

I just created a comment on another issue https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/718#issuecomment-241192281 stating frustration on awesome lists that have a large backlog of PR's that are waiting for weeks or months to be merged.

I would like to propose a change to the Code of Conduct and add something along the following lines:
- Potential awesome maintainers should be aware/warned that maintenance can be a time-consuming business, and they should be willing to spend it (within the boundaries of reason, of course).
- Awesome lists have gained traction, not only in open-source community but in broader IT world. It is used more and more as an authoritative source (well, that sounds a bit strange, given the laissez-fair approach it started out with, but still) in software selection and to proclaim new products, to raise awareness.
- Especially that last point leads IMHO leads to a new responsibility for the maintainer, namely to merge new entries within a reasonable timespan, or - if that is not possible for some reason - ensure there is another maintainer that can do the merging.

WDYT?

Although, if for example 5 persons say that a resource is useful then it could/should be a reason enough to include this resource to the curated list.

Just like the `awesome` badge there should be a script that marks entries with a consistent 'NEW' label when they are committed and subsequently checks whether other 'NEW' labels in the list still deserve that label. There could be a configurable time an entry is considered new (e.g. 30 days by default).

In principle, it should not be hard to write a small bot that runs e.g. on Travis CI to check:
- that all commit titles in a PR are not just ""Update readme.md"",
- that the repository is added at the bottom of a category, 
- that a new repository:
  - is e.g. older than 2 weeks,
  - contains the awesome badge,
  - contains a ""CONTRIBUTING.md"", and
  - contains a ""LICENSE.md"" or similar file.

Those are all mechanic checks that such a bot could carry out instead of a human being. Probably we can make this bot even react to the GitHub PR with an error message and even close the PR: personally, I would be quite ruthless when it comes to handling such inconsiderate PRs: if it is too hard to read some instructions, I am pretty sure it is too hard to maintain an awesome list.

The danger of this idea are false positives: people that are of good faith who get their PR closed because of this.

504,Helping reader find most relevant content,open,[],2016-01-25T19:40:20Z,dmitriz,"First of all, let me thank @sindresorhus and everyone else for your titanic efforts to make these lists so awesome, it is greatly appreciated!!!

The problem I'd like to address though, is a challenging task to keep the lists relevant as things can move very fast and projects become deprecated, obsolete, outdated, unmaintained etc. As an example I can mention [the list of AngularJS seed projects](https://github.com/gianarb/awesome-angularjs#seed-projects), many of which are sadly quite old and full of what nowadays considered bad practices.

Showing some of these old projects to a newcomer without proper warning can actually be considered **harmful**, as people can mistakenly learn some bad practices from there without being aware that they are. Especially with AngularJS this feels like a problem with people misjudging the framework based on the outdated information, when modern best practices actually solving many of those old problems. Given the current fast pace of the JavaScript ecosystem and the overwhelming and growing amount of information, this problem will likely only get worse.

On the opposite side, the most modern, recent and relevant projects can **sadly blend and get lost** amidst other older ones, making it hard for the reader, especially beginner, to find them.

So I'd like to suggest to discuss possible ways to mitigate this challenge, and help the reader by adding various meta-data beside the links that would help to decide which links to check first.

I have previously proposed [to timestamp the list entries here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/issues/432) as one possible meta-data that may be easy to automate and @sindresorhus rightfully suggested it belongs here. It is based on the assumption that the resource was considered ""awesome"" at the time when the link was put and the reader would quickly see when that happened.

I think that would really help the reader with the type of resources whose awesomeness might change fast in time. I'm sure the author would not put many of those links now but wants to keep them for historical or whatever reasons. 

It is not a perfect solution and might not be so helpful for other types of resources, where other clues may be needed. However, it is a simple information that would keep things more transparent, and may have different use for different people. Also it would help the maintainers to feel less guilty and less responsible for the content by clearly saying how old it is.

As @sindresorhus [pointed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/issues/432#issuecomment-172311291), this metric may be flawed e.g. for `npm` packages, where other information could be useful such as:
- the number of downloads;
- the number of stars;
- the number of open issues;
- the date of the last commit;
- the size of the package with all dependencies.

Especially the package size with dependencies and how long it takes to download is what I found very hard to estimate in advance.

Of course, any meta-data generation should be fully automatic and should not add any burden to the author. If anything more can be done to save the author's time -- the better!

229,Guidance on what the name of a list that contains these entries should be?,closed,[],2015-07-11T06:45:29Z,icyflame,"These are kind of the things that I want to add to this list :- 
1. [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
2. [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)
3. [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law)
4. [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome)
5. [Flow - psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)

Some of the things that are common about these entries are :-
1. Some of them are related to Programming, Open Source. (1, 2, 3)
2. All of them are one of `Adages`, `Aphorisms`, `Psychological syndromes`,
   `Psychological principles`.
3. They are easy to understand, and behavior starts to make sense after
   understanding their gists. (Especially with 1, 2, 4, 5)

I thought about naming the list :-
1. `awesome-behaviour` : Almost everything on the lit is related with behaviour,
   except for entries like 3.
2. `awesome-psychology` : Entries list 2 and 3 do not fit.

So, I would like your opinion on :-
1. **Does an awesome list feel justified?**
   
   I do believe that a list must exist that has a list of all these things. Although, I think that the content is very fragmented. As there are a lot of things that could be part of this list, and the list could probably end up being called `awesome-miscellaneous`.
2. **Do you think that Wikipedia is the right source to link to, for entries like above?**
   
   I am slightly uncomfortable about using WikiPedia as the only source, because content keeps changing, and there's no concrete verification of the information being entered. Would you rather that the list have a link to the Wikipedia page, alongwith the link to a paper/article in a respected journal / blog post by a respected person in the field, along with the entry? This would make the list harder to build, and accept contributions to, but I guess it would be worth it, as everything there would actually be _curated_.
   
   Of course, this list would be something that you can consume in your free time and get to know
   more, so, in that perspective, Wikipedia seems good enough.

P.S. I have read the [Awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md), and the contributing guidelines for some awesome lists. Yet, I remain indecisive.

Common things I open issues about in lists:
- Missing license. Here we can suggest the same as this repo or CC0 or some other CC license.
- Missing contributing.md. Can just suggest copying the one in this repo and modify it to own needs.
- Succinct description to each item.
- Commentary on each item. Added by the submitter of why the item is worth reading/consuming. See https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi#cities-in-flight-1970-by-james-blish-40 for example.
- Grammar. I find an amazing amount of typos in the lists people make.
- It's readme should have a clear description of what the list contains.
- Quality check added content. Not everything is worth adding. It should be a curation of the best, not a list of everything.

Having all lists follow this would improve the quality considerably.
