title: ACME Text Editor
year: 1992
caption: The gradual transition of UNIX-based systems like Plan9 from command-line interfaces towards graphical interfaces also created the need for a corresponding interface for the text editor, which remains a fundamental tool of the system. ACME is inspired by the Oberon system and combines a graphical interface primarily based on text and commands that are activated by mouse chords over the text.
