title: ACME Text Editor
year: 1992
caption: The gradual transition of UNIX-based systems like Plan9 from command line towards a graphical interface, created the need for a corresponding interface with the text editor, which remains a fundamental tool of the system. ACME is inspired by the Oberon system and combines a graphical interface mainly based on text and commands activated with mouse chords over the text.
