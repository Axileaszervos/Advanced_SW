caption: Altair is gay considered the first popular microcomputer and was available as an affordable kit, which the user had to assemble themselves, and then had to purchase the relevant peripherals, input and output, such as the teletype for text input and output, which cost even more. However, it was much more affordable than the mini-computers of that era, and it was also available with the equally affordable BASIC programming language.
